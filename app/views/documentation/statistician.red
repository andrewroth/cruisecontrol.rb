h1. Showing a progress chart based on CodeStatistics for each project

Used an idea from "O'Reilly Ruby":http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2008/03/cruisecontrol_charts.html. Converted it to a bulder_plugin, which first collects the statistics and then creates a svg file after build has finished. CodeStatistics is called once per build, the results are captured, charted to track trends over time. You'll get CodeStatistics if you run <i>rake stats</i>.

p(hint). A symbolic link will be set from 'public/images/charts' to 'shared/charts' where the generated charts will be stored as svg files. Look at 'config/deploy.rb.example' to automate this task in capsistrano when deploying CruiseControl.rb.

you'll get a chart like this:

You can configure the chart with:
<pre><code>
project.statistician.test_filter = ["Model specs",
                                    "View specs",
                                    "Controller specs",
                                    "Helper specs",
                                    "Library specs",
                                    "Unit tests", 
                                    "Functional tests",
                                    "Integration tests"]
    
project.statistician.code_filter = ["Libraries", 
                                    "Helpers",
                                    "Controllers",
                                    "Models"]
</code></pre>

p(hint). If you think of more trends to display, the architecture will make them easy to add. Starting by counting the lines of tests & code, and calculating their ratio.
These signals occupy different orders of magnitude, so a logarithmic scale reveals their common slopes. We use Gnuplot to make such charts easy; this paltry output is only the beginning of Gnuplotâ€™s abilities.
